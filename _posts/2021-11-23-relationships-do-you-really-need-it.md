You may ask yourself a critical question that many people never ask themselves. Do I Really Need Relationships?

Invest in meaninful relationships – and I don't mean finding a companion or a marriage. I'm talking about making genuine connections with friends, coworkers, mentors, bosses, peers, and anybody else you like and appreciate.

> All of the studies indicates that the quality of our connections affects the majority of our pleasure in life.
Having good friendships to depend on is a terrific approach to generate possibilities for yourself in life. So, if I were you, I'd be actively seeking out meeting new people and taking the chance of expressing myself with them.

And I'd also think about expanding your existing connections with your parents, siblings, old friends, and anybody else you have, since investing in those relationships is an important element of truly living in your early days. I wouldn't base it on getting married, finding a partner, or anything else like that. Simply pay attention to the individuals in front of you and see where your interactions lead you.

At the same time, start investigating anything that interests you. I'm not just talking about you pouring your heart and soul into your job. If this coincides with your job goals, that's fantastic, but it can wait. I'm referring to discovering something that truly energizes you. It might be a problem, an activity, a puzzle, a sport, a goal, a craft, a game, or anything else at all. To put it simply, play around, investigate, find that thing, and then take baby steps toward it every day. Forget the larger picture, and forget about generating money. For the time being, just pursue your interest. If you do this regularly, it will gradually pull you towards your "purpose" - I know that phrase is overused, but that is exactly what it implies here. But, to be honest, doing something you're passionate about doesn't have to be that significant. It might just be entertaining or fascinating.

In fact, I'm a strong advocate in starting small. Small is ok. Also, invest in yourself by reading a lot and sharing what you learn with those you know. Perhaps even with a few folks you haven't met yet. Apply what you've learned in new scenarios and situations with new issues.

Become a true enthusiast about one or two topics that interest you. Also, and this should go without saying, take care of yourself. Eat healthily and exercise on a regular basis. This will be quite beneficial for anxiety and despair. I know you've heard it before, but it'll also make the rest of your life so much better. This is a game changer, thus I'd make it a top five priority anyway.

And deal with problems in your life front on. Inquire about deeper existential issues, such as "what should my life be about, what does it all mean, and what should I do with all these sentiments I have about my history and my purpose?" Find a decent person. Someone who understands you, pushes you, and initiates conversation.

Finally, I'd like to attempt some new experiences. A lot of what I'm doing and intend to do more of is traveling around and gaining a plethora of new experiences. Experiencing new things excites me, but it also exposes me to different ways of thinking, living, eating, and so on, which has allowed me to grow fast. I grew up rapidly and gained a lot of life experience in a much shorter period of time than my contemporaries, which helped me get a head start. And in many respects, this might help you make up for lost time without taking a decade.

So go grab it, buddy. I know you're a bit late to the party, but that doesn't matter. You're at the party, and you're still so young. You have plenty of time to enjoy your life, so good luck.
