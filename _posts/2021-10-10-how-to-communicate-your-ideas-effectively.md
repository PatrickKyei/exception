## Why Mind Mapping Is Useful

Mind mapping is a useful method for exploring ideas and discovering links and connections. Mind mapping may be used to examine what you already know, an existing structure, or a brand new notion in order to get as many thoughts out as possible. It's not a difficult procedure, but it may be a new way of looking at information at times.

A lot of the time, these procedures may become a little tangled. You can start over, but it's also fine to make errors, cross things out, and have something that isn't flawless. So, starting with your life, you might want to consider your hobbies, passions, education, and job experience.

## How To Create A Mindmap

So, once again, pen and paper are my go-to tools. It's generally a good idea to begin with a topic you're familiar with. As a result, I propose that you begin with yourself. So you want to place your name in the center of the page in a circle. Starting in the centre and working your way out. In general, I like to work clockwise, but with all of these approaches, you'll discover out how to adjust them to your needs and what works best for you.

Create spokes radiating from the center of the circle to emphasize these various areas of interest. One of the reasons I enjoy mind mapping so much is because it allows you to make connections that you would not have made otherwise.

A simple way to mind map is to start by putting a subject in the middle of the page. From there, you can draw spokes out from the main ideas and write words or draw pictures at the end of each one. You can continue drawing spokes out from each new idea/image, or connect existing ones by drawing lines between them. Of course, this method can be adapted to suit your own personal style. As long you write down words, images, or ideas and connect them, you’re following the mind-mapping method!

## Storyboards

Storyboards are an excellent method to visually explore ideas and experiences. It's not about becoming a great artist, once again. Storyboards are used to communicate concepts.

If you wish to work on your first storyboard, consider the following. Consider where you'll be in a year. How does that scene look? Draw it, but also give it a title. It's a good idea to provide a date just so you have something to refer to. As we acquire more data, it may get overwhelming, so knowing when you produced something is helpful.

If you are with a team they're also a fantastic method to engage with team members and communicate with different stakeholders and those involved in the process, in addition to working through your own ideas visually.

Another exciting aspect of storyboards is that you never know where an idea will take you. Another thing I enjoy doing when I'm going through these visual experiments is documenting my work. It not only helps me discover it later, but it's also something I might use in a future presentation or pitch. And, as I previously stated, I'm a terrible at drawing, but it's all about the concepts here.

## Storytelling

Storytelling has grown in popularity in both the design and business sectors. In fact, believe it or not, storytelling is one of the abilities that companies are looking for these days. Stories have the power to move people, catch their attention, motivate them, and convince them.

Stories are what make information relevant and impact our emotions. Stories are what draw us in and make us want to know more. So, as a storyteller, the worst thing you can do is go in chronological sequence and say this occurred, and this, and this, and this.

One of the most difficult problems for speakers is that they like talking. They could go on and on about these topics that they are so enthusiastic about and like. People want to hear it, but they don't have time for it. And they want to remember what they hear.

### Tips and approaches for telling a story and presenting your ideas

* Try to be concise with your message

* Use Visual helpers. It's easier for humans to remember an image they saw than some random words they read

* Let your visual helpers be closely ralated to the message you want to put across
