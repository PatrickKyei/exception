## Introduction

We really don't understand leadership like the way we think we do.

In our minds, we often hold this idea about what a leader should be or look like. There are things in leadership that makes things work and effective and these things are effective in the short term only. And this is bad leadership. Often times we say that if something is stupid but it works, it isn't stupid. And if you apply that to leadership you will say, well if something is bad in leadership but it works is it bad? For example abusing your people, been dishonest etc. And the answer we will mostly come to is that to some degree this is bad.

As followers sometimes we want leaders who are nice and particularly caring and nice to us. But other times we are willing to give up some of that because we want to be part of something that has been created that we judge to be special.

It seems like we often think around the question that if you are a leader do you put your vision first or your people first. And we may ask , "Is there a right answer to that question?"

I don't think there's a single right answer. I think it is a balance. You can't find a single leader with the answer that says I care about the mission and I don't care about the people. And even though there are many leaders that say that the only thing they focus about is their people, that is not entirely true. Because they have to worry about been profitable, they have to worry about serving their stock holders and they have to worry about their clients. And so to simplify it and say that it is just about taking care of people is never been actually fully correct. At the same time many thoughtful leaders understand that the most valuable resource they have are the people - the thing that actually creates the most viable valuable.

### The Leadership Hype

The nature of how we record history and how we do biographies hype the leader as the central player. As the reason things happen or don't. A leader may or may not have made a big decision to cause things to happen or change, but there are a thousand other things that might happen by countless other people behind the scene or below the water line that were going on and other contextual factors also. So often leaders roles in a company are much less than we'd imagine it. And they may have not even be the star of their own life but they might have been the player.

When we look at great leaders who we think are successful and we try to emulate them, it's always a bad idea. Because no one could be oneself except the person. I think that you can learn techniques from good leaders that you are around and u can also learn things not to do from bad leaders. But too much, leadership has to be based on who u are and even more of leadership has to be built on who your followers are and the context in which you are leading. Because one style of leadership isn't going to work the same way in a different context.

So the key thing for leaders to understand is that there is not one leadership style that is right and the other is wrong. Every leadership style needs to be based on the connection to your followers. You understand what is it that inspires or drives them. And the understanding that the environment around you is not only going to be complex and you have to deal with that, but also it's the understanding that is constantly changing. So what you do on any given day or any given instance has to be based on all of those factors.

In any organisation, almost all the answers in that organisation is below the leader. So it shouldn't be a case for people to wait for the leader to come with the right idea or decision. The thing is for the leader to help create an environment that the right answer could come out. And what the leader can do is be an advocate for that. And that takes a little bit of coming to grip with your ego.

### First Myth

**The first myth** about leadership we often come to is that if you are born with the right traits or if you can develop the right behavior then you can become an effective leader. And people sell a lot of leadership and management books with a list of things you can do. The reality is that we will find no cases where a set of attributes or qualities that worked for someone are transferable. There are things that work in others but every situation is so unique, every time is so unique.

And even for the same leader, to be a leader on Monday in certain way and try to use exactly the same technique the next day often is a loser. Then you'd say you'd have no consistency. But no, the reality is that your consistency is your ability to adapt to the situation at the moment.

### The Second Myth

**The second myth**, the attribution myth is really reinforced by things like biographies. Because we often hear that an individual was a man of their time. But that's always a gross of over simplification. They may have had a significant role in it but if we look through the limbs of history, we tend to sharpen that focus on that person. Like putting the spotlight on them. And all we see is the actions of that person and we tend not be aware of all the other things that are happening. And so the danger of the attribution myth is that we start to think that all we got to do is get a good leader and all the problem is solved. And the reality is that that's not true. It's actually the organisation, the followers, the context of the situation that matters so much. And we see that a leader who does one thing in one place and is moved to another place and tries to repeat it almost never succeeds. And so the consequence we find is that it's very contextual into what the leader does and that is reinforced.

### The Third Myth

And **the last myth** is the result myth. And that is the idea that we are clear-eyed calculating people and so we follow and elect the leader who will most give us what we want. And we think it will make the most money in the company, it will win the victories on the battle field, accomplish the most politically. And the reality is that it is not true either. In reality what we find is that the actual performance, measurable outcomes by many leaders got nothing to do with how successful they are in terms of been selected or promoted.

Our connection to leaders is more human, it is more organic. We want something from leaders that they provide and it is not that strict bottom line result. We are willing to tolerate some pretty negative or disappointing result from leaders if they fill some other needs in us.

So if one asks how do we go find a right leader? Who should we look for?

People with straight teeth and good posture?

We will find it is not that easy or simple.
