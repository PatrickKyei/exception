> 3 am thoughts

In the midst of life's bustling chaos, there's a quiet corner of my heart where your memory resides. It's as if you were never really absent; you were always on my mind, etched into the very fabric of my thoughts.

There are moments I've looked back upon in the tapestry of our journey, realizing I might not have painted our story with all the shades of love it deserved. There were times when I faltered, allowing the noise of the world to overshadow the melody of your heart.

If ever I made you feel like a distant star🌠✨ when you deserved to be the sun, ☀️ 🌄 know that my heart carries the weight of that realization.

You were always on my mind, not just as a fleeting thought, but as a constant presence, a part of the symphony that orchestrates my days. Your absence is but a canvas for the colors of your memories to paint upon, making each moment a masterpiece of longing.

So now, with these words, I hope to bridge the gaps that my silence might have created. Tell me, dear, that the sweet love we shared still flourishes, that the echoes of our laughter haven't faded.

I yearn for a chance to rewrite our story, to paint it with the hues of affection that were sometimes absent. Grant me that opportunity, to prove that what I hold for you has only grown stronger, that every moment we shared resides within me, etched into my very being.
