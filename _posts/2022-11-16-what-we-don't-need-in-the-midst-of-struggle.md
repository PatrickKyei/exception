There is a lot of judgement that goes on around us and in the midst of the communities we live.

> What we don't need in the midst of struggle is shame for being human

Judgment of our motivations for doing this and refraining from doing that.  
Pointing fingers everywhere you go.  
There are constant insults and derogatory language directed at you.. 

And then you begin to accept and conform.  
You hold yourself to a standard that is lower than acceptable and look down on yourself. 

You ponder whether you are the only one experiencing this struggle and deserving of this standard of judgment.

**But here is the truth.**

Each of us is going through or has gone through a struggle.  
The time in their lives when they were at their lowest point.  
Whether due to tragedy, unavoidable circumstances, or a cause of a decision they made.

Everybody has experienced feeling inadequate, powerless, and life-overwhelmed.

This is how life is right now.
That is how it feels to be a human.  
The joy comes in overcoming the tragedies, challenging circumstances, learning to make better decisions.

Due to the fact that we have all experienced a comparable situation, we don't need to use slurs or point fingers.

What we need is compassion and empathy.  
Rooting for each other to come out of any unfavorable situation we may find ourselves.

> Because what we don't need in the midst of stuggle is shame for being human.
