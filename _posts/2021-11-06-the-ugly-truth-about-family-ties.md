## The Old Way

If you've ever lived in a typical African household, particularly a Ghanaian family home, you've definitely witnessed how strong the bonds between parents and children can become. This is wonderful, yet the same good thing can also stifle one's development.

It's a widely held belief that a child will always be a child to their parents, particularly their mother. And this is a typical occurrence in Ghanaian society. Even in their 20's and 30's, some African parents treat their children as if they were teens. This is in stark contrast to the way a Western family or household views the parent-child connection. There would have been nothing wrong with this, but it is impacting how youngsters (the youth) think for themselves and take action to investigate new opportunities that would improve their life.

## The Downside Of Attachment

Children develop a strong attachment to their parents and rely on them to guide them in every decision they make in life, eventually becoming more reliant on them. One of the tasks of parenting is to help children become self-sufficient and capable of making decisions about their own life, but this does not mean that parents must make all of their children's decisions. A youngster raised in a Western family is more likely to take the initiative to explore areas of personal growth, which is why so many of them have gone on to become inventors and worldwide innovators.

## Growth And The Need For Change

As we get older, we have our own ambitions, objectives, and goals that may differ significantly from those that our parents had in the past or even imagined for us. This is a wonderful thing, but parents and children must recognize that they will no longer be able to live with their parents at some time in their lives. Especially if you want to have your own family and pursue your dreams and goals. As a result, breaking away from your parents and the familial bonds you've grown up with may be necessary.

It might be tough at times due to the dread of making life blunders, as well as the realization that it will be a great responsibility on your shoulders to make the proper decisions and manage your own life. As a result, it's critical to recognize that in order to do so, you must be willing to accept and take the cost.

## Make The Hard Choice

So, while I understand that this doesn't make the decision any simpler, I believe it's worth pausing to consider how critical it is for you to be able to take this next step in your life. So, in the end, you'll have to make a decision. That decision will have an opportunity cost in either case. I realize it's inconvenient, but life is like that. If you move away from your parents, you must give up your old ties, and if you stay, you must give up your goals and ambitions. Both of these chances appear to be extremely significant to you, but at the end of the day, which do you feel to be more essential for you right now, at this time of your life, in terms of achieving your objectives and breaking away from familial ties? Which of the two is shaping the life you wish to live in the next five, ten, or twenty years? Which one, for now, deserves to be your top priority?
And I wish I could answer that for you, but you are the only one who can. But I'll provide a few suggestions that could be useful.

## Taking Steps

To begin with, moving away from your family does not imply that you are abandoning them. If you and your parents have a close tie, it doesn't mean your relationship with them is over. It stinks and might be annoying at times, but it doesn't have to be the end of your relationship. It's extremely feasible to travel or move away in order to explore life and seek better possibilities for yourself, or to do anything you like, and so perhaps you and your parents will remain in touch utilizing various techniques of maintaining a long distance relationship in this contemporary day.

You get your career back on track, your parents figure out how to live their lives on their own, and you guys alternate monthly visits. That's exactly what you'd have to do until you figured out a way to rekindle your relationship with your parents. Surprisingly, you could find this time apart invigorating in some ways because you'll have to go out of your way to contact, visit, send emails, and remain in touch, as well as miss each other. When you finally see each other in person, it becomes more meaningful and enjoyable.

## Being Away And Staying In Touch

So being away might not be as bad as you think it would be if you guys figure out a way to stay connected, which I'm sure you will, and if there is a light at the end of the tunnel, it's not like you'll be separated indefinitely. You already know that going away for a definite number of months or years is a lot simpler.

Also, there's a compelling practical reason to prioritize your life and career right now. In my opinion, one needs a route in life, and if you continue to stagnate out on the plains, you may find it difficult to provide when you do settle down, particularly if you want to have a family or if your parents are elderly and may need to rely on you later in life. So you're pursuing your job and life objectives not just for yourself, but for the entire family.

## Your Call To Make

So, as I previously stated, I am not in a position to advise you what to do, but I am leaning towards you following your career or ambitions and investigating new areas of potential over the next several years. So, whatever you pick, the only way to cope with the opportunity cost is to either crystal clear on what's essential to you and accept that life is full of trade-offs, or you find a means to reduce the opportunity cost or generate new ones.

So, if I choose a career route, I will find new ways to communicate with and engage with my family. This time apart might be utilized to strengthen your bond in various ways. Once a month, plan a weekend getaway so you may share new experiences with your family. At the same time, you may take advantage of the uninterrupted time away to invest in yourself and your goals so that when you and your partner become closer, you'll have a solid professional foundation in place, perhaps freeing up even more time to spend with your parents in the future.

## Good Luck

If you roll with the punches a little, you can convert a bad situation into a fruitful one. And be willing to put in the effort to make the most of it. So, kudos to you, ma guy, for taking this next big step in your life and profession. I realize it's a difficult decision, but keep in mind that this chapter will one day be a footnote in your incredible connection with your parents, so good luck.
