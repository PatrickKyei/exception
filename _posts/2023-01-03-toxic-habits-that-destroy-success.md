Toxic habits are behaviors or patterns of thinking or doing things that can be harmful or destructive to an individual's well-being or success. These habits may have negative effects on a person's physical or mental health, relationships, work, or other areas of their life.  

Some examples of toxic habits include procrastination, negative thinking, lack of discipline, poor time management, lack of self-care, lack of focus, inability to adapt to change, lack of accountability, inability to accept criticism, and lack of gratitude. 

It is important to recognize and address toxic habits in order to improve one's overall well-being and achieve personal and professional goals.

## Procrastination

Putting things off until the last minute can lead to rushed, subpar work and missed opportunities.

## Negative thinking 

Our thoughts have a huge impact on our actions and outcomes. Negative thinking can hold us back from taking risks and trying new things.

## Lack of discipline

Without discipline, it's easy to get sidetracked and not follow through on our goals.

## Poor time management 

Not effectively managing our time can lead to missed deadlines and a feeling of being overwhelmed.

## Lack of self-care 

Neglecting our physical and mental health can lead to burnout and a decrease in productivity.

## Lack of focus

Constantly being distracted by things that are not important can prevent us from making progress on our goals.

## Inability to adapt to change

Being resistant to change can hold us back from new opportunities and growth.

## Lack of accountability 

Not being accountable for our actions and decisions can lead to a lack of progress and success.

## Inability to accept criticism

Being unwilling to listen to and learn from constructive criticism can prevent us from growing and improving.

## Lack of gratitude

Failing to appreciate what we have and constantly striving for more can lead to a lack of contentment and fulfilment.
