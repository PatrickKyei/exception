Our ancestors used different forms of data to make informed decisions about their daily lives. Their hunting expeditions were influenced by what they could tell from the skies by observing the weather.

Those that engage in farming were informed by weather and seasons.

> Many years ago people had to look up the skies. Today, we look on our phones.

Today, we have so much data which is very close to our reach. Whether you'd need to wear warm clothes or pick an umbrella to work is something you can decide with a weather app on your phone. You can be informed about what commute you'd use for work by Google Maps.

These everyday informed decisions helps to make our lives easier.
