I found my uniqueness  
And embraced it  

I felt my pain  
And healed from it  

I observed my anger  
And released it

I revisited my regrets  
And forgave them

I discovered my weaknessess  
And mastered them

I saw my grief  
And held space for it  
Before transmuting it into love

I met my fears  
And surrendered to them  
Choosing to act in spite of them

I witnessed my flaws and insecurities  
And accepted them

I embraced my inner child  
And comforted them

And I found love  
And welcomed it into my life  
Allowing it to pierce my inner life  
And radiate out to all whom crossed my path

And that is how I discovered  
What it means to be whole.
