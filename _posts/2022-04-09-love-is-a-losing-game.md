> **4** Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. **5** It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. **6** Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. **7** It always protects, always trust, always hopes, always perseveres.

Love comes with a lot of promises. You go into it hearing many promises and giving a lot of promises of your own without knowing exactly what to expect in return. So yeah, from the onset, you start giving something without knowing what to get in return.

What are your beliefs, principles, values in a relationship? You go in compromising and giving up a lot of them. Maybe that's how it's designed to be? I can't really tell.

## You Lose everything in Love

Most people believe the notion that **"falling in love"** is a beautiful package full of everything they've ever wanted: companionship, passion, friendship, and so on. The truth is that a relationship is an empty box at first. Before you can take something out, you must first put something in. There is no love in relationships.

> The moment you admit to loving someone, you admit to having a lot to lose.

People have love within them. And in a relationship, people place a high value of love into it. In a relationship, there's no romance. It's up to you to instill it in your relationship. A pair must learn and practice the art of providing, loving, supporting, and complimenting in order to keep the box full. The box will be empty if you take more than you put in.

So I come back to the main point:

> Love is a losing game, we only learn to become better losers.

## How do we become better losers?

Yes, it is just as it sounds; become better losers. Since we've gotten to know we don't enter into a love relationship expecting to gain everything but rather losing ourselves, then the question is; how much of ourselves can we lose?

One cannot keep pouring from an empty cup. You eventually become dry and weary. In every relationship you must have a sense of when you are losing too much of yourself. A point where you have to make an awakening call to your partner to invest in the relationship.

You have to know when even too much can become unhealthy for your relationship. Just like how the sea can have an overflow and destroy valuable things, one person receiving too much of everything in a relationship can be toxic. Your partner may become callous, indifferrent, proud, unloving etc.

So it remains on each of us then, to protect what is invested in the relationship. If you feel too much is been taken out of it and it can affect the relationship negatively, it is time to talk to your partner.

A conversation about how you feel is not supposed to end in an argument. All things should be done towards the growth of the love invested in the relationship and to the benefit of the individuals involved.

Remember:
> Love is not self-seeking.
