Every day, we talk about success. We frequently hear success stories. What makes successful people successful often surprises us. Because we often believe that what they did to achieve success is similar to what we do.

Get up, go to work, and put in long hours. Right?

Many people will tell you that you must work hard in order to succeed.

Others may argue that working hard is crucial, but working smart is even more so.

Some would advise you that in order to succeed, you must surround yourself with the right people.

And I always advise that you must continue to learn new things throughout your life.

I'll end here, but you get the picture. Because you have people constantly offering you this kind of advise, you've grasped it all the better.

It's sound advice, but even if you follow it to the letter, you won't be able to succeed until you pay attention to what we are going to discuss.

This fundamental quality has made Elon Musk the world's richest man and a space and automobile industry revolutionist. His innovations have changed the world and continue to do so even now.

**This quality is perseverance!**

It is necessary for success. This image captures the difference between someone who will succeed in life and someone who will not:

The loser will try 99 times and give up.

The winner will fail 99 times before trying again and finally succeeding.

You must be patient and never give up in order to succeed. Always learn from your mistakes, evolve, and march on.

**Are your goals important enough for you to be able to pursue them for 3 years, 10 years, 15 years?**

You merely need to ask yourself this question. If you answered no, you're probably not pursuing the right goals. You'll be handicapped if you don't set goals that will motivate you to push yourself for as long as you need to.

So the first thing you need to do is to set goals that really motivate you.

Once you've accomplished this, you'll be able to keep trying year after year, despite the numerous failures that will occur along the way. You will eventually succeed if you do it with the same zeal each time. Eventually, it will happen.
