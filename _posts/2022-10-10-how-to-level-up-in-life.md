## Stop wasting your time

I always see people not studying, not working a job or not even caring for basic stuff. Get your stuff together and start focusing on your dreams.

## Sacrifice now, rest later

Always have this principle that whenever you sacrifice something now, you will rest later. I guess you know how the opposite works.

## Start reading

If you come here and you don’t read, then now is the best time to start. Reading is going through the thought process of others. You’re basically copy-pasting ways of living and many other different stuff from others.

## Write

Writing helps you organize your thoughts and new ideas, so that they’re not just some notions in your mind. Have you ever tried to explain something you thought you understood to someone and then you were just as confused as the person you were speaking to? Yeah, get your thoughts straight.

## Exercise

> It is a shame for a man to grow old without seeing the beauty and strength which his body is capable of, said Socrates. 

Other than just strength and beauty, there’s also a lot of benefits for exercising, such as **stress relief**, **increase in serotonin**, **testosterone**, etc.

## Take responsibility, at least for your own failures and mistakes

Your first step to improve is to fix your own mistakes. That’s why you shouldn’t compare yourself to others but to who you were yesterday. The person who you were yesterday has had all the same successes and failures as the person you are today, in addition to knowing that person the most.
