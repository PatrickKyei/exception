I am slowly learning

That in life Many things occur in slow motion

Such as the growth of a tree

The blossoming of a plant And the emergence of new life

And that in the same way That a flower blooms slowly

Beautiful things in life

Take time to flourish and come to fruition

am slowly learning That there are seasons in life for growth

And seasons for rest And similar to flowers

We break, shed layers or fall apart

Because we are blossoming

I am slowly learning

That we feel alive

When conquering old fears

Embracing the unknown Exploring what is new

Discovering our hidden talents, strengths and abilities

Sharing laughter

And treasuring moments spent with those we love

And that times of productivity Are equally as valuable as times of rest and rejuvenation.

I am slowly learning

That the caterpillar and the butterfly Are the same creature

At different stages along the same life journey

And that one is not greater or more magnificent than

the other

And I am slowly learning in life

How much is still truly a mystery And that rather than feeling limited or restricted by this

fact

I can choose to embrace the beauty of the unknown

As within it lies infinite potential.
