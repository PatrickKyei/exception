We all go through life learning very valuable lessons. We learn, relearn and unlearn things. And there are ways we could do things better if we had a second chance. Here goes a few:

## Own your reality, not the reality of others

I'm a firm believer in seeing things as they truly are, and I'm not going to lie to you: you're going to be confused by life at times. You'll attempt to compare your life to others', or people will try to persuade you to live the way they do. 

You must find your own route, your own method of doing things that works for you. If we listen to the voices that contradict who we want to be, we may never be able to settle.

## Cut all toxic people out of your life

Do not welcome toxic people back into your life, no matter how lonely you get on your path. Engaging with toxic people saps your motivation, passion, purpose, and sense of meaning in life.

## Get in some form of exercise every day

There is now widespread agreement on the value of physical exercise. 

From elementary school to university, we were taught the importance of exercise. And sometimes you don't just need it for your body; you also need it to cleanse your thoughts. 

Get a gym membership, or make it a habit to jog, walk, perform yoga, or conduct your own aerobic exercise at home on a regular basis. 

Maintain the health of your body and mind.

## Learn how to calm yourself in tough situations

We are all likely to face some form of difficult situation in our lives and how we comport ourselves will speak volume about how we will deal with other people.

## Stop procrastinating

The thing is that you keep saying you'll start from tomorrow, but if you really wanted it, you'd start now. 

Set goals, form habits, and pursue them, and you will make history.

Procrastination leads to stagnation when it comes to your personal and professional relationships. 

Don't put it off, and don't do it later. You will stagnate if you procrastinate.

## Find a job you love, not one that just pays the bills

When the love for mankind (service) and the passion for a product (solution) combine, the desire to get up every morning to work is always fresh. 

Love what you do because of what you can accomplish for people. Love for service and love for a solution; that's what brings out the passion.

## We are mediocre at many things, find one thing you are GREAT at and “double down” on that

Find out what you are excellent at and what genuinely excites you. 

Take small steps toward it every day, and set aside the larger vision for a time. 

For the time being, follow your curiosity; if you do this regularly, it will gradually prod you towards your purpose.

## Rid yourself of negative self talk

Take charge of who you are and what you want for yourself. 

Stop downplaying what you care about and your hopes. 

- Take control of your desires, ideas, and perceptions. 
- Own your fire.
- Own your no-saying and yes-saying. 
- Take charge of your emotions and mood. 
- Take charge of your plans, your path, and your success. 
Almost every successful person begins with two convictions: the future can be better than the present, and I have the ability to make it so.

## Surround yourself with like minded people

A lot of things also come down to identity, right? Our identity is often wrapped up in beliefs and you want to let a few things into your identity if you want to be able to think as clearly as possible. 

Therefore make sure the people you move with share similar visions and goals with you. 

Otherwise you will lose your sense of purpose and get distracted towards your goals and journey to a better version of yourself.

## Get outside at least 20 mins a day

Creativity is sparked by adventure. 

Get outside and live life. 

Speak to someone, open yourself to new adventures and you'd be surprised the good things that can come out of it.

## Read on a topic that interest you that you don’t know much about

George R.R. Martin once said, "I have lived a thousand lives and I have loved a thousand loves. I've walked on distant worlds and seen the end of time. Because I read."

It is enjoyable, inexpensive, and beneficial to read books. 

A single large book will keep you entertained for several hours, as well as prompt you to analyze and reassess certain aspects of the world around you. And, what's more, you can get that one book for almost nothing.

## If you have the time and resources get a pet

Dogs are often referred to as man's best friend, but they aren't the only creatures who have a special place in humanity's heart. 

Having a pet may help you deal with loneliness, decrease stress, enhance your mental health, and provide you with a chance to meet new people. 

If you are someone who is thinking of having or raising your own family, that's one way to start from.

## Drastically reduce your time on social media

We are unaware of many mental processes that occur when we spend time on social media. 

What is genuine and truthful in our story becomes clouded. 

We don't consciously think about it, yet it happens all the time. 

It may mostly influence our confidence and self-worth, especially if we start comparing our lives to those we see on social media, which are frequently not as they appear.

Spend more time with family and friends, and embark on adventures. Those are the approaches to live a genuine life.

## Quit comparing yourself to others

Don't compare your beginning to the middle of someone else's life. Don't compare your first chapter to someone else's 20th. 

Everyone began somewhere, so get out there and begin.

## If you are in a toxic, abusive relationship, leave

A toxic relationship leaves you feeling unsupported, misunderstood, disparaged, or abused. 

On the most basic level, any relationship that makes you feel worse rather than better over time can become toxic. 

Toxic relationships can exist in a variety of settings, from the schoolyard to the workplace to the bedroom.

It is not your job to fix an abuser, it not your job to love someone who doesn't want to be loved and it is not your job to change anyone who is not ready for change. 

Remove yourself from any relationship that doesn't make you feel valued.

## Start changing slowly, take baby steps. Slow but steady progress

There's nothing more attractive than someone who knows exactly what they want and are dedicated to get it. 

Make this shift in your life. Start with baby steps as you grow into the person you want to become.

Just as the saying goes, "Dream big and Start small."

## Quit trying to find love, do the above and love will find you

The goose chase for love is crazy and never ending. Live your best life, be yourself and you will meet someone who can connect with the true you.
