I am a young, passionate individual who has always been involved with initiatives that seek to upskill people from all walks of life with the ability to use technology to better themselves in the way that they live and work.

I have spoken at several tech conferences and had the opportunity to interact with [creative minds](https://youtube.com/channel/UCsAjtT-RYQRtMngsTGLxS2Q) in the tech industry to share their knowledge to impact the tech ecosystem.

> Here are my thoughts on a few crucial things about life 

### Relationships

I am a strong advocate and believer in building your network and relationships that will help you in your career growth.
Keep investing in your skills and relationships because those will save you. And start putting them together in a way that makes your career doable for you. You can always create your path in your life if you keep in the work.

People keep in touch with me all the time saying, "All things considered, I realize I need to build connections, yet I don't have time. I have relatively little cash. I don't realize anyone to introduce." And I'm generally giving similar response, you needn't bother with that stuff. Simply be insightful.

Start where you are, look around, be of service any place you go. The cash, the connections, those will follow. Being liberal with your time, your talent, your attention, that is in a real sense free. The best gift you could leave your generation isn't cash or properties; the connections you build around them. That is the means by which I need to be, just an amazing case study in the best kind of relationship building. So I will bring that with me into my career and relationship building. I trust you all do as well.

### Life

You can be a victim of circumstance, but you don't have to remain a victim of that circumstance forever. You can transcend your circumstances. I don't give a f*ck; I don't care what your race is, I don't care what your gender is, I don't care what your sexuality is, I don't care what your religion is. You can transcend your circumstances if you want to. The moment you think you can't is the moment you won't.

### Love

I think Love is a beautiful thing.  
It has been one of an ancient motivator that has caused men to perform wonderful acts of service.
Most at times I find we undervalue it, abuse other people because of it. Others have become hopelessly helpless in the name of it, men have conquered kingdoms and nations in search of it.  

Many times we can't find words to describe what we feel about the people in our zone.
We could say we like them a lot or care about them very much.
They make us happy and we like it.
Probably they are helpful in our toughest moments.
In our sadness they make us feel better,
nudge our pain and our fears.
I guess sometimes we don't find the right words for all that they made us feel.

> Would it not be okay to say we love them?

Maybe one would disagree which I won't find it surprising.

**But what is love actually?**

If the effort we put in is not love, then what is it?

### Legacy

Maybe my greatest legacy will be that I made you realize the truth, the talent you wield, the potential you have and the great impact you can make in this world. Maybe that is all and probably I might be fast gone within realms only hoping that you've found the fundamental truth about how awesome you are and able to touch the world with a spark of your light.

### Some things in my favorite list

#### Music

I listen to music occasionally, especially when I am in a focus-mode getting some really important project done or when I need inspiration to write. I play some of these songs in my playlist - I hope you like them as much as I do.

Podcasts are another way to entertain, amuse and educate yourself. They are all sound, with no distraction coming from how people look or dress like you might get from watching a TV show or film.

#### Books/Articles

Reading stimulates your cognitive capabilities and your logical capacities. It starts up your creative mind and stimulates the memory centers of your mind. It helps recall data just as it stabilize your emotions. The importance of a reading habit is that it strengthens mental muscles.
