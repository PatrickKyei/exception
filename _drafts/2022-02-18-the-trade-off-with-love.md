> Love is a broad and delicate subject that is contested all around the world. Many of us have tasted its bitter or sweet side in one way or another.

## The Effects of Separation

Life throws us into a lot of unexpected situations, and we occasionally have to deal with things we weren't expecting.

One example is suddenly having to end a relationship with someone you adored and held so dear. It's difficult and hurtful at times. You may feel as if you've lost everything and that the world is collapsing around you. The pain you may feel after a separation or break up from a loved one is equalled to physical pain.

So it's not very helpful when someone you care about asks you to sacrifice a lot in order to be with them or stay together — It's not always them; sometimes it's just the way things are. It is especially painful and feels like a burden when it is put upon you to make this big decision. When you are compelled to make this major decision, it is very unpleasant and burdensome.

## The Bitter Scenario

Have you ever loved someone so much that it feels like you two know everything there is to know about each other, that you can understand each other even in silence? But you can't be together or see each other anymore because of religious differences, career opportunities, health condition, education, tribe, status in the community, or simply because of some principles, and one of you has to sacrifice one of these things in order to stay togethet?

Oh, man, this is a difficult one. In either case, there are some important trade-offs to be made; there is no such thing as an easy choice here. This, I believe, is what makes life so intense.

## Life is all about Choices

There is rarely a single clear road that leads to all you desire. You're continually making decisions that require you to give something up. But the nice thing about these roadblocks is that they give you an opportunity to check in with yourself and figure out what you actually want.

So, obviously, I'm not in a position to tell you to give up your values or let everything go and go with your relationship . We can only think about how to make this decision and help you make the one that will help your future self.

And you make this decision by sitting down for a few hours, going for a stroll or a run, or going somewhere else where you can be alone with yourself, and weighing your two possibilities. What are the advantages and disadvantages? What are the things that are most important to you?

Is it your commitment to your job, belief, education or other endeavors and their fulfillment, or is it your devotion to your current relationship?

And I don't just mean everything that matters most to you because that can be tricky. Your brain could keep you stuck because the brain wants everything. It's terrible with trade-offs and it can argue both sides of a decision till the cock crows.

## Bring Your Own Decision to the Scene

What brings you the most joy in life? Which job would motivate you to get out of bed in the morning? What kind of growth do you wish to achieve? What kind of community would you like to join? Is it your education or your relationship that gives you the most satisfaction? Those are also vital questions to ask yourself. To be honest, it's probably more significant than the practicals and logistics.

## Can you bend the situation?

Another thing I would recommend is determining which parts of this equation are genuinely fixed and which are flexible or might be made flexible.

**If it's about your education,** could she/he be happy if you took 3yrs to get your masters or your degree? Could you guys commit to a relationship for a year and then get married whiles you are still in college? Maybe you don't have to completely sacrifice the opportunity to pursue your education at all.

**If its about your job taking you to another place,** do you work in this role for a few years and then negotiate going remote so that you could go back to be with him/her? Is it possible to agree to visit each other twice or once a month? Maybe plan a vacation trip together once every three month?

All of these things are possible if you open up the aperture a little bit.

## Clarify Your Priorities

So take some time to clarify your priorities, but also look for ways to manage the circumstance to your advantage as much as possible.

Life is rarely as fixed as we believe it to be; there are always hidden chances, unexpected rewards, and multiple interpretations of events, and you will never be able to perceive them all at once.

You may have to take a leap of faith, but if you stay aware, put in the effort to be outstanding at what you do, and cultivate meaningful relationships with others, they will almost always present themselves. That's what I've noticed.

## The Trade-Off

Having said that, it is conceivable that you may have to give up one or two items as a result of this decision. I understand, but that's life. If you truly want this career and your pursuit of love doesn't fit into your plans, you might have to part ways for a time and maybe you'll find your way back to each other, or maybe you won't and you find a new love in your new chapter of your life who wants to climb the career ladder with you all the way up.

## Connect With Your Self

I'm not sure, guy, life may be chaotic, but whatever you do, take this as an opportunity to reconnect with yourself. What do you desire? Who do you want to spend the rest of your life with? What do you care about? Speak with others you trust to acquire further opinions. Communicate with your partner. You can't go wrong if you follow what thrills you beyond money, prestige, and practicalities. So good luck, man, it's not an easy decision.

## KEY TAKEAWAYS

Life is all about making decisions and making trade-offs. Making opportunity costs and difficult decisions to surrender one thing while keeping the other is what life is all about.

In essence, it comes down to your priorities and considering what would be best for your future life. If you want to pursue love, you may have to give up or sacrifice something extremely essential to you. Take the path of love if it would make you happy and content. But do it with both your intellect and your heart, not just one.

Most importantly, seek the advice of some extremely significant and knowledgeable individuals in your life, such as your parents, a counselor, a pastor, and so on. It will lighten your load and provide a clear picture of the issue where your opinion appear obscured.
