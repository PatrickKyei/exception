Dear  

It's been weighing on my mind for a while now, and I can't keep it to myself any longer. I'm concerned about the misunderstanding that happened between you ad I.

We used to be so close, and I never thought anything could come between us. But then something happened, and now I feel like there's a rift between us. I don't even know how it started or why it happened, but I do know that I miss my friend and I want to make things right.

Maybe one day, we'll meet again and have the chance to talk about what happened. Until then, I hope you are living the best life and doing all the things you've always wanted to do. I want you to be happy and fulfilled, even if we can't be close like we used to be.

I wish I could explain to you how much you mean to me and how much I value our friendship. I want to tell you that I'm sorry for whatever I did to cause this misunderstanding, and that I'm willing to do whatever it takes to make things right.

But until that day comes, I'll just have to hold on to the hope that we'll be able to reconnect and talk about what happened. Until then, I'll continue to send good thoughts your way and hope for the best.
