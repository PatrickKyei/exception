To the person who feels that they are fading away  
And losing passion and motivation for living:

May you remember that  
There will be seasons in life  
That are difficult in nature  
When you naturally lack passion and inspiration  
And feel devoid of all motivation and energy

When you feel completely stuck, stagnant  
And incapable of moving forward

When getting through another day  
Feels like climbing a mountain

Mustering a smile  
Feels like a daunting process

And feeling good about yourself  
Feels like an impossible task  

And this is completely natural  
As there will always be ups and downs in life   
Due to its cyclical and contrasting nature

And in these times  
May you choose to shower yourself  
With the same love, care and kindness  
You would show a close friend  

May you choose not to think less of yourself  
For finding life challenging, difficult and overwhelming

May you regain energy  
By taking time out for yourself to rest and recharge

May you find the strength to take small, concrete steps  
Towards getting better and accomplishing your dreams  
Trusting that as you gain momentum  
Motivation will follow

May you choose to release what is no longer serving you in your life  
Such as feelings of shame, guilt and judgement

And may you trust  
That just as there are better times that lie behind you  
Better times also lie ahead

And just as a caterpillar  
Undergoes a cocoon phase  
In order to become a butterfly  
You too will re-emerge  
Following a period of rest, growth and transformation More confident, capable and powerful  
Than ever before.
