I figure there's no better person to tell the story than myself, for I am the one who lived it.  

As I sit here and look back on the journey we've shared,  
I realize that letting go was the best thing I could have ever done.

I stopped trying to hold on so tightly,  
For I didn't want to become a barrier to your happiness.  
Though I wanted you for myself,  
It didn't mean that I should fight against your happiness.

For in that space of loss and heartache,  
I found a newfound clarity and strength.

And in that quiet moment of letting go,  
I found the courage to chase my dreams and be true to myself.

And now, as I sit here, looking forward to the future,  
I am grateful for the lessons learned,  
For the love that was given,  
And for the hope that still burns within me.

I therefore believe that I am the best person to tell the story.,  
For I am the one who lived it,  
And I am the one who knows,  
That when the world comes down,  
I will be thinking of you, always.

And with that thought, I'll find the courage,  
To keep moving forward,  
To chase my dreams,  
And to be the best version of myself,  
For you and for the world.

With all my heart, I say,  
Good luck to me and all the best,  
For in this journey of love and life,  
I know that anything is possible.
