## Some people die at 25. We just bury them at 75

You'll run upon people who have entirely lost touch with reality. They are not ready to answer to any call to life, no matter how much hope you try to build in them.

It is not your responsibility to devote all of your time and energy to such folks. Spend time with those who respond to your appeal and avail themselve to your support.

## Quitters never win and winners never quit

Nobody recalls the man who came last. Learn to relax when you're tired, but never quit. Quitting never gets you anywhere. Be a fearless fighter who goes after what she wants. Continue to try until you succeed.

## Sometimes the only person who can help you, is YOU

People are more likely to push you if you initiate the push. Your life is entirely your responsibility; whatever you wish for yourself go for it. You are the only one who understands how much you desire it.

## You are both of light and the dark. You don’t have to deny any aspects of who you are

Those who make an effort to be polite and friendly are attempting to live their best lives. We all have both good and bad in us. You are living your best life if you are doing your best to be a good person.

## Control your ANGER because it’s just one letter away from ‘D’ANGER

Anger is a feeling that is meant to inform us about what is going on in our bodies. However, if we do not learn how to deal with that message, it has the potential to be a huge destroyer.

Don't make decisions based on your emotions. Make an effort not to allow your emotions control you.

## You will always recycle your experiences until you change your thinking

Our thoughts have a significant impact on our life. "A man is shaped by his thoughts," according to one quote, and I agree. You must train yourself to think positively and filter out negative thoughts.

## Life is supposed to be difficult, but it doesn’t need to be painful

The more you focus on the bad aspects of your problems, the worse the pain becomes. Allow it if the people around you are willing to assist. A shared problem is half solved.
