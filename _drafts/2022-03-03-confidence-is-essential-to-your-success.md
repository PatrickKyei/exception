> Many people miscontrue confidence with arrogance.

In the part of the world where I grew up, there is a widespread misconception that if people know what you are up to, you will not fare well in life.

Many people have believed this misconception, and it has had a negative impact on many aspects of their lives. Because of some of these old beliefs, so many people have lost crucial qualities such as confidence, the ability to connect with other humans, and the ability to be open to new ideas.

## Healthy Ways To Promote Your Confidence

Although it is not healthy to go about, especially on social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram, broadcasting very sensitive details about your life, there is a good reason to keep your close niche up to date with some relevant milestones in your life, particularly when it comes to your career, education, spiritual growth, and so on.

If you start telling people who you want to be and who you're striving to be, which is a lot more honest first, you can then make decisions here and now that are intentional toward that goal rather than just doing everything behind the stage curtain.

## Live In The Lime Light

When you're in the lime light of your life, you can be confident that you are not going to be alone.
You must take your place on the stage. The world needs to recognize your potential and the difference you are making. Value yourself, your voice, your body, your thoughts, your dreams, your pride, and your ego. You have the RIGHT to take up space.

What you end up doing is creating a better feedback loop in your environment where people can actually watch you in real-time becoming who you said you'd be. Because they're hearing you say it, and you'll be able to avoid those who aren't going to support your goals.

## It Is Important To Practice Self-Worth

However, if we don't tell people where we're going, they won't notice any difference in us. They'll just assume, for the most part, that you're the same person. So it's crucial to start telling people your new narratives because you'll eventually start to become consistent with the future version of yourself rather than just been the former version of yourself.

Nobody else will do this for you if you aren't prepared to do it for yourself.
People will take advantage of you if you do not promote yourself.
Promote yourself to improve your perceived value in the eyes of others.

## Why You Need To Promote Yourself

When you promote yourself, you boost your self-esteem and improve your mindset.
Whether we realize it or not, we are all in the business of selling.
One of the most crucial skills a person can develop.

## The Misconceptions About Self-Worth

We think that extreme modesty, reserve, and allowing others to "discover my abilities" is the way to go. I learnt the hard way that it is our responsibility to inform people about what we have done and what we can do in the future. Being unable to promote oneself restricts opportunities, money, and your network. Make others aware of how outstanding you are in your position.

## Be Fearless

Please don't attempt to be as little, silent, accommodating, and handy as possible in your daily life. Even if your voice shakes, express your self-worth and personality. Don't commit to extreme types of modesty; instead, claim your beauty, intelligence, and passion. Always be fearless and unapologetic.

## KEY TAKEWAYS

- You have to cultivate the habit of self promotion.
- Confidence is a learned skill. It improves with practice.
- You will face opposing views when you start to express your convictions. Stand your grounds; change makes people uneasy and you should expect that a lot.
