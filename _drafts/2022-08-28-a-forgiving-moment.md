Don't try to forgive.  
Forgiveness is not a 'doing'

Simply accept that this moment is exactly the way it is
right now.  
And the past was the way it was.

Accept your non-acceptance in the present.  
Forgive your inability to forgive.  
Feel your breath, the sensations in your body, the life that burns brightly in you.

Everyone is doing their best, even when it seems like they are doing their worst.  
Everyone is dreaming or having a nightmare, battling with pain you may never understand.  
You don't have to condone their actions.  
You may not be able to wake them up.  
You don't have to like what happened.

Simply let go of the illusion that it could have been any different.  
You are different now, anyhow.  
Don't focus on something you have no control over.  
The past is a distant land.

Bring your attention back to this moment,  
Your source of true power.  
Your place of connectedness.

Wake up from the dream  

That anyone has any power  
To take away your inner peace.

Drop the need to be right.  
Embrace the need to be free.  
Come out of the story of 'my life.
Reclaim the moment.

Be here, in your new life.  
Show up for this brand new day.  

This is forgiveness.
