Many times we grow up to believe certain things and consider them as facts without investigating the truth in them. We slouch about thinking deeper into them because we believe many people think the same.

In the same way, there are some misconceptions about relationships that have been generalized as the truth. But if you think about them carefully, you will find out there are the other truths.

You can grow up to be a well educated person yet lack the facts into these things if you have not asked or thought deeper about it.

## Misconception 1: Networks are inherently self serving

Many people falsely think that being in a relationship is more about what they will gain from it than what they can contribute. Any relationship you enter with this preconception is guaranteed to fail.

Keep a handful of meaningful relationships.

It may be true that our relationships with family and friends are the most dependable. However, there are occasions when the uncommon contacts in our network turn out to be quite valuable connections.

Let's consider starting or running a business. The majority of the people who will patronize our business in its early phases are those whom we once met at a party, business meeting, or church or mosque. Your second stage clients are your immediate family members. The folks you occasionally speak with are your real clients.

The people you say hello or hi to only when you come online. 

## Misconception 3: Relationships should form naturally

If you don't make a conscious attempt to get to know someone, even if you cross paths with them more than once, things will still be the same.

You may create the value you want if you consciously consider making an investment in your relationships.

Our thinking is that a person does instantly become your friend after saying hello to them - No.

If you put in the effort, friendship and any other type of relationship work.
