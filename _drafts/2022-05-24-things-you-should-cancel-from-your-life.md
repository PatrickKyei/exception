## Comparing yourself to others

> Comparison destroys character.

Stop comparing yourself to people who started 10 years ago before you. Focus on your own journey.

There's nothing wrong with drawing inspiration from the lives of others who have become successful in their lives. But don't obsess on why they're performing better or possessing something you don't.

You may learn a lot from the choices they made and the actions they took to get to that point in their lives. But let the focus be on improving yourself and becoming better.

Progress, not comparison, brings happiness.

## Arguing with others

Before you start arguing with someone, consider whether or not they are mentally mature enough to understand alternative points of view. Otherwise, there is no point.

> You might win the argument, but you won’t change their mind, so what’s the point?

In any circumstance, your goal should be to understand the nature of the problem rather than to win the argument or to feel right. As a result, all sides will feel heard and understood.

## Negative news

You're merely polluting your thoughts unless you're willing to do something about it. And if you share the news with others, you’re polluting theirs too.

## Procrastination

Another person has already saved enough for 3 years for themselves and their family while you've been procrastinating for 10 minutes.

Procrastination simply makes things worse. Acting, on the other hand, makes you shine. And if you act consistently, you'll be unstoppable.

## Doubting yourself

Self doubt kills more dreams than failure does.

> You need to stop the habit of doubting yourself.

Whatever you want to do, if it is worth pursuing, start now.

Start where you are. Start with fear. Start with doubt. Start with hands shaking. Start with voice trembling, but start.

If you do, you’ll attract reasons to support your assertion.

You have what it takes, don't ever doubt.

> Imagine what's possible once you stop doubting yourself.

## Settling for Less

> All limitations are self imposed.

The only limits in your life are the ones you put on yourself, so dream big, and be bold.

Create the life you wish to have and deserve. **I'm not talking about being reckless**. I'm asking you to LIVE abundantly, know your worth and Love your life. Don't waste it by liveing less than what you were meant for.

> There is no passion to be found in settling for a life less than the one you are capable of living. - Nelson Mandela

## Staying on your Smartphone in important conversations

Staying on your smartphone during meetings or crucial discussions is a bad habit. Even when you think you're paying attention to the other person, it demonstrates that you're not.

It sends the message to the other person that anything they're saying is unimportant. And this has the potential to damage your relationships.

Everything has its own time. Learn to approach each moment in the same way.

## Aimless social media browsing

The internet and social media have a lot of positive aspects. There are numerous strategies to market a business on social media sites such as Facebook, Tiktok, and LinkedIn these days.

However, wasting time idly exploring social media is detrimental to your health. Spend less time on social media if you are not building connections, selling a product, marketing your business, learning a skill, or selling your talents.

Don't become a victim of social media.

## Working without breaks

Good work is good, but so is good rest.

Overworking your body will cost you a lot of health problems in the future, if not now. Take a break and take care of your body.
