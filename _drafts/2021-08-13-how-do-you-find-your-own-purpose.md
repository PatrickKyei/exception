## How do I find my Purpose or Passion?

![purpose and passion](/assets/img/purpose-passion.jpg)

This is one of the most frequently asked questions by both the young and the old. And I've always disliked this question. Because asking it indicates that we are supposed to find something magical, and that we haven't found it yet, and as a result have somehow failed in life. Many others have attempted to answer this question, usually in exchange for large sums of money. So let's take a deep breath and try to unravel this conundrum.

### The thin line between Purpose and Meaning

How can you discover your purpose when so much of your life is meaningless? When you go through moments in your life when you are not in touch with your purpose, your sense of meaning fluctuates. How are we supposed to figure out "what we are intended to do" when life isn't always pre-programmed with meaning and purpose?

![thin line](/assets/img/thin-line.jpg)

This is something that many people get hung up on. They frequently remark things such, "I don't know what my purpose is," or "I haven't found my genuine calling." And questions like these are hazardous because they imply that whatever you're doing right now is garbage and a waste of your time because you're not doing it on purpose - you haven't found your calling. And that, to me, is hazardous because it feels as if you've failed until you find this "miraculous" thing.

There is now an occult of purpose that the world has manufactured. And the cult of purpose holds that in order to be happy, fulfilled, successful, grounded, and so on, you must have a very clearly defined external purpose, which must become your professional work. But if your profession isn't 100 percent connected with this deep-rooted purpose; if it doesn't provide you with utmost meaning, you're doing something wrong. And I believe that is a flawed and uninteresting approach to the most significant subject we will face as people.

Of course, it's great if you can find a career that suits your purpose, but for the majority of us, life doesn't work that way. Finding your purpose is not a simple task. It's confusing and chaotic. Nonetheless, there are certain principles and actions we can take to achieve true meaning and purpose in our lives. And it all starts with distinguishing these two things.

### Purpose and Meaning

We often use these terms interchangeably. But when people talk about finding their purpose I think they are usually talking about feeling a sense of meaning.

![meaning](/assets/img/meaning.jpg)

And **meaning** is about giving our lives purpose, making them important, interesting, exciting, and challenging in the proper ways. **Purpose**, at its most basic, is the means by which we investigate that importance. To uncover your purpose, you must first choose an activity or role, or a combination of behaviors, projects, goals, or even relationships that will allow you to access and develop on that deeper feeling of meaning.

As a result, we might argue that meaning is the what and purpose is the how. And as humans, we are hardwired for a feeling of meaning. That is a part of who we are. There is no avoiding finding meaning; the reason it is such a tough and engrossing issue for many of us is that we all want it so badly. *One of the main reasons this has become such an issue is that we all believe it will come from work.*

But if you ask someone who is raising three children or a mother, I doubt they will say their life is pointless. But we believe that unless we turn this hobby into a job, we have failed. Many people believe that someone who is working on their so-called purpose as part of their professional identity is more meaningful or purpose-driven than a mother who receives a great deal of meaning from raising her children. However, these two things are equally important to those two persons. It all boils down to what they value and how they live their lives.

The crucial thing to realize is that humans have an innate need to discover, investigate, and expand meaning. Our purpose is to investigate this meaning, and when those two things align, life becomes a lot more interesting. Simply put, meaning is discovering our life's significance in general. And "purpose" is essentially the means through which we attempt to find that meaning. And I believe it is critical to keep it as basic as possible since it does not need to be complicated; otherwise, we will not find it.

### The Reason People Seek Purpose in Life

Having a purpose in life provides us with an anchor and some protection from some of life's more challenging aspects. "Those who have a why to live can bear nearly any how," remarked Viktor Frankl, a psychologist.

It's also crucial to remember that it's about more than just feeling excited; it's about how we handle our lives. As a result, meaning is the what, and purpose is the means by which we arrive at the what.

### The Truth About Meaning

The truth is that meaning is highly personal. It is specific to each person and evolves throughout one's life. There have been far too many distortions of purpose, and this is what we should be able to discern and avoid. One of the ways this is pushed is that you must have a purpose in order to be happy. You've failed if you don't. Second, it needs to be your work. You can't have hobbies and enjoy your family at the same time.

So we've been exposed to this online idea that we somehow have to make dressed and standing in front of historic automobiles something to define success. And this isn't good. Because it causes you to stray far from your intended goal. And it causes you to make poor choices. At the end of the day, meaning is often derived from a few common sources.

### Where We Can Derive Meaning From

![where is meaning](/assets/img/meaning-where.jpg)

One of the most important is relationships. It could be a romantic or love relationship, a platonic relationship, intimate or distant friendships, familial, or professional partnerships. That is like one big bucket of meaning, and we all extract some meaning from it to some extent.

Another big one is beauty. Which I think includes art, nature and any connection we have to what we find interesting or stimulating out in the world.

Another is suffering, which is a strange way of saying we may take meaning from this really terrible experience. But the point is, suffering is a great teacher. It's not always instantly useful, and it's not something we'd want to join up for. But how many people have gone through really difficult situations just to learn that it was precisely those conditions that provided them with so much? You can get a lot of things. Whether they suffered through a breakup, lost a job, or lost a loved one.

Another is, of course, selfless service and charity. And it all boils down to giving, assisting, and contributing worth to other people's lives. This can be done on a professional or personal level. There's volunteer work, pitching your network, building connections among your acquaintances; there are numerous ways to be generous. But the most important factor is service.

![growth](/assets/img/growth.jpg)

The final big category is achievement and growth - ambition, goals, betterment, and self-growth. And all of these are meaningful ways to discover how much we can develop and learn in life, which is a significant source of meaning. We're talking about this because these are the underlying sources of meaning that can underpin any form of purpose you can think of. You can investigate all of those sources of meaning in a variety of ways. You may, for example, be a painter or sculptor to investigate the meaning of Arts. You have the option of becoming a teacher, a critic, a musician, or an archaeologist. These are all different goals, yet they all come from the same source of meaning.

So purpose is varied, and one could argue that it is probably limitless. The deep sources of meaning, on the other hand, are fixed. Let's keep these in mind as we go through these concepts because, at the end of the day, I believe you'll discover that meaning can only come from a few areas, but it's really up to us to figure out what our purpose is among the thousand alternatives.

So, to summarize everything we've discussed thus far, when you're fighting to find your purpose, pause for a while this fixation to find this notion, the headline that says "This is my mission," and start digging for the meaning behind it. And it doesn't always imply that you understand your bigger purpose. However, when you have a connection to the core meaning, all types of employment can become highly purposeful.

It's a lot easier to follow meaning and let meaning show you "what your purpose is" as you follow it than just try to pick a purpose and reverse engineer the meaning.

### Then How Do I Find Meaning?

The natural next question is, "Then how do I find the meaning."

![find meaning](/assets/img/find.jpg)

But here's the thing, and again I really believe that it's important to make this super simple because when it gets complicated then it is not useful and probably wrong.

We are meaning making machines. We are wired to find and experience meaning. I would say that eighty percent of this journey is paying attention to what is automatically meaningful in the day to day of our lives. You could be one hundred percent lost in the bigger picture and still have an intuitive grasp of what you find significant.

There's one thing you should keep in mind. Meaning doesn't just assist us navigate from situation to situation in the hopes of getting closer and closer to our purpose; it may also help us discover the purpose within the situation we're already in that we were missing because we weren't linked to the underlying meaning.

### The Bending Curves

![bending curves](/assets/img/bending-curves.jpg)

It is also vital to highlight that you must be willing to be lost. And many of us aren't. Uncertainty stinks, I get it. However, this trip is continuing; it is a dynamic and lifetime process, and if you are afraid of becoming lost, you will have a more difficult time discovering your purpose. Because we enjoy expecting to be completely on purpose all of the time, our lives should feel purposeful all of the time. This is not only needless, but also impossible.

I believe that anybody who has discovered their purpose has experienced periods of uncertainty, perplexity, and intense self-doubt. And the strange thing is that people don't want to talk about it because it's not very interesting, and once you're on the other side, you forget how frightening it was.

**There is a journey that is not fully logical and is really challenging. But if you keep paying attention to what you find meaningful and expand on it, those periods of uncertainty and self-doubt will nearly always turn out to be the pathways to your mission.**
