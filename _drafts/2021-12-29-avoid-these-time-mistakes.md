If you've lived in Ghana for a while, you've probably heard the expression "Ghana man time."

The name arose as a result of most Ghanaians' attitude toward time. It is an attitude that has wrecked many relationships, caused many individuals to lose their jobs, caused many people to miss out on life opportunities, and has led many people to believe that they will never be able to overcome or modify their attitude towards lateness.

If you have an appointment with a Ghanaian, it is 'normal' for them to be late or not show up at all without any prior warning.

We've explored a variety of approaches to resolving this issue. The most typical one that comes to mind is writing down the names of "late-comers" in elementary and secondary school and punishing these "late-comers."

It is an issue that I believe should be addressed individually by all Ghanaians. We will not be able to fix this problem unless we comprehend the seriousness of the situation.

This is something I've been thinking about a lot. One of the challenges I encounter in Africa, and which every caring African is concerned about, is keeping track of time. You know, as living people, we only have time. In other words, your life is simply the time you have on this planet. When you say someone is 70 years old, it indicates he or she has spent 70 years of time, or 2,207,520,000 seconds. As a result, I believe that respecting any human being requires respecting their time. If you insult their time, you are disrespecting the entire human person, which implies that you don't mind squandering that moment of their life that has been given to you.

That is how serious it is! Murder is a serious offense in the legal system. Murder is the act of terminating someone's life; the time they have on this planet. So if you waste an hour of someone's time, you've done half murder. This is the gravity of the situation.

So, while interacting with individuals, you must recognize and value the time they invest in your care. When someone approaches you searching for a service, utilize as little of their time as possible and give them their life or time back to them to determine what to do with it.

Now, when you take the time to serve them, make sure it's quality time and that they remember.

Time has two aspects: the shared quantity of it and the quality of it.

You have no control over quantity, but you do have control over quality. So, if you have the opportunity to assist someone within the time they have given you and share a portion of their time, take advantage of it as soon as feasible. If you need to prolong it, get their permission and demonstrate compassion; don't waste their time since you're wasting their life. Also, make certain that the time you spend with them is of high quality. And whenever they think of you, it's because of the quality time you spent with them, and they want to relive those moments with you. And that is what life is all about.

We got it all wrong in Africa. When you are successful or a big person (someone of greater rank), you have the right to disregard anyone's time.

I truly believe If we solve our problems in Africa on time, the rest will fall into place, and this is not a joke. And if you want to think about innovation, think of time rather than anything else.

Is the new product or service going to save time or deliver quality time? It has to fall under one of these categories. It's either save time or provide quality time; nothing else counts.

## Key Takeaways

- Show up at appointments at least 15 minutes early.

- If you cannot make it on time to your appointment, send a message to the other person and let them know you will run late.

- Sometimes it is better to postpone an appointment than to make it to the appointment late. Been there late can affect the quality of the meeting as you may rush to conclusions and it can affect the quality of the meeting.
