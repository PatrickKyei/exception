Unexpressed feelings never die,  
They linger like a silent sigh.  
Deep within the heart they reside,  
Aching to be set free and tried.

Though they may remain unspoken,  
Their power and strength is never broken.  
For they are like a burning ember,  
That flickers and glows in December.  

They are like a song unsung,  
That echoes in the heart and lung.  
They are like a whisper in the wind,  
That carries a message we can't comprehend.

But still, they wait for us to see,  
The beauty and power they possess, to be.  
For unexpressed feelings never die,  
They are always there, a spark in the sky.

So let them out, let them be heard,  
For unexpressed feelings never die,  
But they can make our hearts fly like a bird.  
And set our souls free to reach new heights and fly.  

So never hold back, never be shy,  
For unexpressed feelings never die,  
But when they're shared, they're the reason why  
We find love, and happiness, and come alive.
