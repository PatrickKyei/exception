Our everyday lives are shaped by the decisions we make. We may choose to live a happier and more successful life if we turn our decisions into little daily habits and techniques that we can put into practice. Motivation alone is insufficient for me. It's a waste of my time if I have to read a whole book, article, post etc. without learning a single technique or habit.

So, without further ado, here are some modest daily habits to include into your routine.

## 1. Fill your mind with relevant facts

The information you feed your brain has an impact on how you think and how you see life in general. As technology advances and information becomes more readily available, it is becoming more common to encounter bad and biased news. Continuous and excessive exposure to negative and skewed information will have an impact on your decision-making process and the quality of your decisions.

As a result, it's critical to filter the news you get and how you absorb information. At the very least, you should have more than three news sources from which to choose your news. This might assist you in double-checking the facts in your newsfeed so that you can make an informed decision if the various news sources contradict one another.

## 2. Improve your focus each morning by asking yourself, "What is the ONE thing I am dedicated to learning today?"

This habit simplifies things, improves brain focus, encourages you to prioritize your goals, and streamlines your task so you don't easily become overwhelmed by a thousand things you "have" to complete.

Put it on a piece of paper in huge, strong characters and put it on your bedroom or bathroom wall? Save it to your to-do list or set a reminder for it? While brushing your teeth or getting ready, read it aloud and come up with an answer on the spot. Then, while you go about your day, keep it in mind as a reminder of what you've committed to accomplish.

## 3. Early on, engage your most important tasks

Any type of analytical thinking that demands the maximum focus, such as reading, writing, analyzing, or problem solving, is considered deep work. It necessitates a different type of attention than other more tactical tasks we perform on a daily basis, such as cleaning dishes or setting our alarm clock before going to bed. Spend the first 2-4 hours after waking up maximizing your brain's optimal performance time. If you get up at 7:00 a.m., your peak hours are between 9:00 and 11:00 a.m.

## 4. Do a short 20–30 minute cardio workout

Being physically active helps both your physical and mental well-being, and breaking a sweat releases endorphins (happy hormones). Instead of setting lofty goals ("I have to spend two hours at the gym!"), start with a quick workout, either before your daily commute or after you've finished work or school.

Choose a 15-minute exercise, a series of cardio and squats, a power walk, bike ride, or a brisk sprint around the neighborhood as a shorter activity that pushes your body to move. If you're looking for a new challenge, you are here!. Make it a daily habit to exercise for [10 minutes every day!](https://youtu.be/3sEeVJEXTfY) It's the one I prefer.

## 5. Meditation might help you to relax your racing thoughts

If you frequently feel overwhelmed and anxious, a simple 10-minute meditation practice can help you clear your mind of all those racing thoughts.

We have the ability to transform our thoughts by taking responsibility for our own minds. We become happy when we learn to focus our attention on the most essential things in our life and decrease all of the distractions in our lives.

Limit your screen time, particularly your time spent on social media and other online activities. Make better use of your internet time. Instead, read a book, take piano lessons, or join a singing club. All of these things can help us enhance our psychological well-being.

## 6. Read at least one chapter a day

If you haven’t given reading a try, here are some benefits for you to consider.

Did you know that reading enhances brain connections and improves brain function? It's not just my view; research supports it. Emory University neuroscientists conducted a research titled Short and Long Term Effects of a Novel on Connectivity in the Brain, which detailed the advantages. Get a library card, download an audiobook, or borrow a book from a friend to make reading a habit.

## 7. Develop a growth mindset

Think again if you believe that a mental ability is something you are born with. Unlike having a fixed mindset (where you believe you were born with a set of skills and abilities that are in your "nature"), cultivating a growth mindset requires you to push yourself outside of your comfort zone, challenge beliefs about what you can and cannot (or "should not") do, and re-program your mind so you can develop your core qualities and skills through consistent efforts.
