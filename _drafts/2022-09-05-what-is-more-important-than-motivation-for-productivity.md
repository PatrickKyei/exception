> “Don't expect to be motivated every day to get out there and make things happen. You won't be. Don't count on motivation. Count on discipline.” - _Anonymous_

There’s something very reassuring in these words, and I agree with this point of view.  
Ideally of course, it would be nice to have both motivation and discipline in your life. But it’s not necessary to always have motivation to get things done. I’ll explain why.

**Motivation** is a drive, need, or reason to take action and move towards a goal. It derives from the word motive — a need that requires to be satisfied. Motivation can be extrinsic (inspired by outside forces) or intrinsic (inspired by the individual). But the problem is that motivation changes over time, therefore it is not a constant. We can be super motivated to start a new project one day, and by the end of the week we don’t feel like doing it any more.

**Self-discipline**, on the other hand, is a practice, a daily habit, a lifestyle. It’s a choice to take action and do something that will get us closer to a personal goal. It doesn’t matter if we don’t feel motivated at that moment. We do not rely on motivation and we do it anyway. Why? Because we know that all the small things we do every day will add up to something much bigger. And, we keep our eye on that future version of ourselves we want to be.

There are several habits you can practice to boost self-discipline:

- **Start your day with a question to increase focus:** What is the one thing I am committed to completing today?

- **Do deep work in the first 2–4 hours after waking up:** these can be complex cognitive tasks like studying, reading, problem-solving.

- **Make it a goal to do the hard work first**, then reward yourself later (a.k.a [practice the Marshmallow experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_marshmallow_experiment))

- **Eliminate distractions** and don’t let social media run your life.

- **Practice a growth mindset** way of thinking by incorporating a few new habits into your day.
