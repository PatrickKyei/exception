If you are a software developer, [github](https://github.com) helps you build all sort of great things. Things that help people, things that could land you a job, things that could change the world and some things that might not. Github is one place that can help you tell the world about all the great things that you are building.

Not bill boards or Inmails, these days you could build a website and there are a lot of options out there.

As a developer or someone in the tech industry, one of the technologies or tools you'd want to master is git and github.

I'm not gonna walk you through how to use git and github, that'd be reinventing the wheel. Instead I'm gonna point you in a very good direction.
It happens Github has a learning lab that can walk you through how to use the technology - I found this out later after struggling many times to find a a good and hands-on resource that could really help me master git and github.

Learn more about git and github with hands-on practice [here](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/first-week-on-github)

## What I learnt from the practical session

### Github Pages

You can have your own, organization, and project sites on GitHub. With GitHub Pages, you can rapidly make a webpage from your GitHub repositories—a great way to share static contents identified with your repo like resumes, portfolios, and project blogs.

**In this course, I learnt how to:**

* Enable GitHub Pages
* Choose a theme with Jekyll
* Use YAML front matter
* Customize your site
* Create and edit blog posts

I was able to answer questions like:

* What is GitHub pages?
* How do I make sites with GitHub Pages?
* How do I create my own blog?

**What I built?**
I built a [simple personal blog](https://dev-path.github.io/github-pages-with-jekyll/) site with GitHub Pages.

## Reviewing pull requests

**In this course, I learnt:**

* What a pull request is?
* How do I request, review, or comment on a pull request?
* How do I accept changes introduced by a pull request review?
* What are the responsibilities of a reviewer?
* What's a CODEOWNERS file?
* What's a diff and how do I use it?
* How do I implement changes from a pull request review?
* How can I suggest a change when reviewing a pull request?

**And I was able to:**

* Create a pull request
* Comment on pull requests
* Leave reviews on pull requests
* Know what’s expected when reviewing pull requests
* Request pull request reviews
* Accept changes introduced by a pull request review

**What I built?**

## Managing merge conflicts

**In this course I learnt:**

* What is a merge conflict and what causes them?
* How do you resolve merge conflicts?
* How do you reduce merge conflicts?

And I was able to:

* Understand how merging happens and what causes merge conflicts
* Resolve simple and complex merge conflicts with ease
* Share best practices to reduce merge conflicts with your team

**What I built?**

## Securing your Workflow

**In this course I learnt how to:**

* Enable security features for repositories hosted in GitHub
* Detect vulnerable dependencies in repositories when notified by GitHub's security alerts
* Utilize best practices to keep sensitive data out of repositories

I was able to find answers to questions like:

* How do I protect my open-source project?
* What should I keep out of my GitHub repository?
* How do I keep sensitive data out of my repository?
* How do I keep track of package vulnerabilities?

**What I built?**
